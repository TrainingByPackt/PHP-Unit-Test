You will find the tests for this Activity under the folder "app/Chapter07/Activity/tests".

The reason for this is that those are not Unit Tests, but Functional Tests: they require an external service to exist
in order to run, in this case, a Database.

In order to run these tests you will need to set the parameters included in the Database Connection class:

- The host, where the database runs.
- The credentials, i.e., a user and a password. The values provided are 'php-user' and 'php-pass', you should change them
to whatever values you configured in the database first.
- The schema, or database to connect to. In the files provided, it is called "app", but you might change it to whatever
name you like most, just do not forget to change it wherever used.

To run the tests, you will need to start the web server in "app/Chapter07/Activity/web" folder. Afterwards, just run
"vendor/bin/phpunit app/Chapter07/Activity/tests".
